Find the intersection of two sorted arrays.
OR in other words,<br>
Given 2 sorted arrays, find all the elements which occur in both the arrays.

Example :<br>
Input :<br> 
    A : <code>[1 2 3 3 4 5 6]</code><br>
    B : <code>[3 3 5]</code><br>
    
Output : <code>[3 3 5]</code><br>

Input : <br>
    A : <code>[1 2 3 3 4 5 6]</code><br>
    B : <code>[3 5]</code>

Output : <code>[3 5]</code>

   ***NOTE : For the purpose of this problem ( as also conveyed by the sample case ), assume that elements that appear more than once in both arrays should be included multiple times in the final output.***
