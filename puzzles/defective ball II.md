<b>Problem</b><br>You have 8 balls all look identical (in shape, color etc.). <br>All of them have same weight except one defective ball which is heavier than others.<br> You can use a two sided balance system (not the electronic one).<br><br> Find the minimum no. of measures required to separate the defective ball and the way you separate it.

<b>Solution: 2 measures required</b><br>
Step Ist: Devide the balls into 3 sets of sizes 3, 3 and 2.<br>
Step IInd: Weight the sets containing 3 balls each.<br><br>
Case a: the balance is in equilibrium<br>
Case b: one side is heavier than other<br><br>
If <b>case a</b> comes, then the heavier ball is in the set having 2 balls.
<br>Weight the balls and find the heavier one.<br><br>
If <b>case b</b> comes, then pick the heavier side and weight any 2 balls out of the 3. Now again we have 2 cases.<br><br>
Case Ist: the balls are of same weight, then definitely the 3rd ball is heavy.<br>
Case IInd: the balls are of different weight. You got the heavy ball.
