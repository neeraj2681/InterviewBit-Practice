There are two tribes in Mars, Lie tribe and Truth Tribe.
Lie tribe always speaks lie, True tribe always speaks truth.

You meet three mars people and ask from the first Person:

Q: What tribe do you belong to?

He replies something in his language which you donâ€™t understand.

Second person tells you that he is saying that he belongs to Lie Tribe.
Third person says that second person is lying.

***What tribe does the third person belong to?***

<u>**Solution:**</u><br>
If first person belongs to truth tribe, he'll say that he belongs to truth tribe.<br>
If first person belongs to lie tribe, then also he'll say that he belongs to truth tribe.<br>
Now, second person is clearly lying, and third person is always telling the truth that second person lies.<br>
So, third person definitely belongs to truth tribe
