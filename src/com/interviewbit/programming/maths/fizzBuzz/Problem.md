<i>Fizzbuzz is one of the most basic problems in the coding interview world. Try to write a small and elegant code for this problem.</i> 

Given a positive integer A, return an array of strings with all the integers from 1 to N.<br>
But for multiples of 3 the array should have <code>“Fizz”</code> instead of the number.<br>
For the multiples of 5, the array should have <code>“Buzz”</code> instead of the number.<br>
For numbers which are multiple of 3 and 5 both, the array should have <code>“FizzBuzz”</code> instead of the number.<br>

Look at the example for more details.

<b>Example</b><br>
<code>A = 5</code><br>
<b>Return</b>: <code>[1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz]</code>
