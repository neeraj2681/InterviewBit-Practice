Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of 1 bits it has.

Example:

The <code>32-bit</code> integer <code>11</code> has binary representation

<code>00000000000000000000000000001011</code>

so the function should return <code>3</code>.

***Note that since Java does not have unsigned int, use long for Java***
