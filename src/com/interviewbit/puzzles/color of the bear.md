<b><u>Problem</u></b><br>
A Bear has fallen from a height of 10m from ground. It reached ground in sqrt(2) seconds.<br> Luckily it didnâ€™t get hurt. What color is the bear?

 Just output the color. For example, following are acceptable answers.<br>
White<br>
Black<br>
Pink<br>
Brown<br>
Yellow<br>
Red<br>
Blue<br>
Green

<b><u>Solution</u></b><br>g comes out to be 10, which is possible only at poles.<r> Poles have only polar bears and they are definitely <b><i>white</i></b>.
